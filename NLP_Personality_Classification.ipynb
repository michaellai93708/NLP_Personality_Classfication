    "As shown in the figures. In terms of the dimension of embeddings vectors, the accuracies increased rapidly from size 0 to 100. The larger the vector dimension, the more aspects of the words can be expressed, therefore higher the accuracies. While with dimension sizes larger than 100, the accuracy improvements were demolished. Which was the problem Mikolov and his team faced, which they solved by increasing the size of training data while increasing the vector dimension (Mikolov et al., 2013). Explanations for this problem might be that some features may carry false information when training with large dimension sizes. The small size of the training data might also contribute since some words in the test set had not appeared in the training set.<br>\n",
    "In terms of window size, larger window size led to lower accuracies. According to Levy and Goldberg, one of the explanations could be that a larger window size would lead the word embedding to be more topic-related (Levy & Goldberg, 2014). Meaning that the embedding trained with a larger window size would result in an embedding that is more MBTI related. Yet, the topics were not significantly MBTI-related for the test set. They were more about the words themselves, which caused embedding trained with larger window sizes to result in lower accuracies. \n",

    "As shown in the above table, with other pre-processing techniques remaining unchanged, removing URLs from the input data would improve the model performance. While keeping all pre-processing techniques unchanged, using lemmatization to pre-process the data would surprisingly lower the model performance. <br>\n",
    "URLs are links to a webpage, and the URLs are usually long, yet they mostly do not contain any helpful information. Moreover, most URLs contain random combinations of numbers and letters, which have no physical meanings. Therefore, removing URLs would not lose much valuable information and will likely improve the model performance since some useless noises (random combinations of letters and numbers in URLs) are removed at the same time .<br>\n",
    "Lemmatization was a method that converts a given word back to its original state. For example, after lemmatization, the word \"is\" or the word \"are\" would be output as \"be\" which was their original state. However, the above table shows that the model trained with not lemmatized input data had slightly better performance. The reason for that might be the poorly designed pre-processing stage. A lemmatization stage follows the stemming stage. Stemming and lemmatization are two very similar pre-processing techniques. This means that there is no significant difference between the data going through only the stemming stage and the data going through both stemming and lemmatization. And that would lead to the trained model having similar performance  "

    "The above table shows that the best-performing model was trained with only glove-twitter word embeddings. The lowest was trained using the w2v skip-gram embedding model. <br>\n",
    "By comparing the input with skip-gram and the CBOW word embeddings, the model trained with only CBOW had better performance. According to Mikolov and his team, CBOW could better represent frequently appearing words (Mikolov et al., 2013). Therefore, one explanation for this might be that in the training set, many words had frequently appeared throughout the data set, causing the CBOW model to out-perform the SG model. <br>\n",
    "By comparing the concatenation input and the single-embedding input, it was apparent that using concatenation input would be better than using a MBTI-trained w2v input. The reason for this would be the size of the data set. Most likely, the pre-trained models were trained on large size corpus, leading the word embedding models to be more accurate. On the other hand, by comparing the concatenation input and the single pre-trained input, the single pre-trained input out-performed the concatenation word embedding input. This might be because the low accuracy of MBTI-trained embedding essentially worsened the performance. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The Twitter-pre-trained model had the best performance might be that the text in the MBTI data set was more oral oriented, meaning that the text was less formal, which was closer to text on Twitter than text on Wiki. Therefore, the model trained with the Twitter-pre-trained model achieved the best performance. "

With that being said, LSTM can store information\n",
